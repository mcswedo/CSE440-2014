<h1>Git</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The Git version control system was originally developed to manage the source code for the Linux kernel. 
Since then, it has become widely used for many projects, both open and closed source. 
In this course, you will submit your work on assignments by committing them 
into a remote Git repository that I set up for you.
</p>

<p>
In order for me to create a remote Git repository for you, 
I need a copy of the public key on the computer your Git client program uses 
when connecting to remote hosts. 
After I receive this from you, I will create an empty remote repository for you.
I will send you instructions on how to clone this repository onto your local computer.
From that point on, you will work in the folder containing your local repository and
push commits into your remote repository from it.
</p>

<p>
I will present 
<a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/441-2013/blob/master/GIT_WALK.md">these notes</a>
about Git in lecture.
</p>

<p>
Along with setting up and learning Git,
you will also practice building a simple C++ program. 
Git and the tools needed to build distributable programs
form the development environment for this course.
</p>

<h2>Instructions (Step 1)</h2>

<p>
Follow <a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/centos/blob/master/GIT-SUBMISSION.md">these 
Git submission instructions</a>
to prepare your system for using Git in this course.
Make sure that you send me your public key as explained in these instructions.
</p>

<p>
Familiarize yourself with documentation on Git
and perform experiments to improve your understanding and working knowledge of Git.
</p>

<h2>Instructions (Step 2)</h2>

<p>
This course will cover 3 development environments:
make, Xcode and Visual Studio.
Although you benefit from learning how to setup and work in all 
of these development environments,
you only need to learn one for this course.
</p>

<p>
The following is a hello program in C++ that you should practice building
and running in this assignment.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char * args[]) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "hello" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cin.get();
}
</pre>

<p class="make">
If you are working under Linux, then you should use 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Gnu Make</a>
to build projects.  You can also use Make to build projects
under OS X and Windows.
</p>

<p class="osx">
If you are working under OS X,
then you can use Xcode to build projects in this course.
Xcode is a free download on the App Store.
</p>

<p class="win">
If you are working under Windows,
then you can use Visual Studio to build projects in this course.
If you are working in JB 360, Visual Studio 2010 is already installed,
so you don't need to install anything.
On your laptop or desktop computer at home, 
there is a free version of Visual Studio named <em>Visual C++ 2010 Express</em>
that you can install.
</p>

<p>
Using the tool(s) of your choice,
build and run the hello program above.
Make sure to include a clean target if you are using Make.
</p>

<p>
You need to wait for me to send you the clone command to create your repository
before you begin step 3 of these instructions.
</p>

<h2>Instructions (Step 3)</h2>

<p>
After you receive my email with the clone command,
run the command in your home directory.
It will look something like the following.
</p>

<pre>
cd ~
git clone your_name@web1.ias.csusb.edu:repo.git 441
</pre>

<p>
This will create a folder named <em>441</em> in your home directory,
so <em>make sure a folder by this name does not exist prior to running the command.</em>
From this point on, I will refer to this folder by the expression <em>~/441</em>.
</p>

<p class="callout">
Tilda <em>~</em> represents a home directory on Unix-like
operating systems such as Linux and OS&nbsp;X.
</p>

<p class="callout">
The git tutorials and git book talk about the <code>git init</code> command,
and you may have experimented with it. 
However, do not use <code>git init</code> to create the <em>~/441</em> folder.
Instead, rely on the <code>git clone</code> command to create this folder for you.
In our case, git clone is a simpler alternative to the git init command.
</p>

<p>
In <em>~/441</em> you will see a file named README.md, 
which contains some instructions
to help you configure git on your system.
Read and follow these instructions.
</p>

<p>
The file's extension <em>.md</em> stands for <em>markdown</em>,
which is a markup language that's designed to be readable in both raw and interpreted forms.
You can think of it as a lightweight substitute for HTML that many programmers use.
You should read about 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">the Markdown syntax</a>.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment, create a folder named <em>git</em> within <em>~/441</em>.
In this folder, you will practice setting up a project designed
to build a shared code base to many targets, including OS X, Windows, iOS and Android.
</p>

<p>
Under <em>~/441/git</em> create a folder named <em>src</em> and place the source
code for the hello program there.
Place other project files in a separate folder.
For example, if you create a Visual Studio project to build the hello program,
then you could put your project files under <em>~/441/git/win</em>.
You can use your own naming convention, but keep platform specific 
project files separate from the platform independent source code.
If you are using make, then you can put the Makefile under <em>~/441/git</em>.
</p>

<p>
Add patterns to <em>~/441/.gitignore</em> to exclude derived,
temporary and user-specific files from the Git repository such as a.out.
</p>

<p class="callout">
I will deduct points from your score on this assignment if you push derived,
temporary or user-specific files into your remote repository.
Use <code>git status</code> to see examine the state of your
working directory and index before committing.
