<h1>Hello World - Input & Movement, Textures & Assets</h1>

<p>
Create a new Unity Project named "Hello World" or something similar. Do not import any packages, and setup defaults for 
your chosen path - 2D or 3D.
</p>

<h2>
<b>For the 3D Path:</b>
</h2>

<p>
Create a scene with a directional colored light and a simple cube with a texture (either that you create yourself or you find online at a website such as <a href="www.lostandtaken.com">Lost and Taken</a>) that rotates along one or more axis using a script component written in C#. Experiment with multiple speeds of rotation.
</p>

<p>
Add mouse or keyboard functionality to change the axis of rotation during run-time (using the same script) and / or to move the cube in eight directions (using a separate script).
</p>

<h2>
<b>For the 2D Path:</b>
</h2>

<p>
Create a scene with a simple sprite with a texture that changes upon mouse click or button press using a script component written in C#.
</p>

<p>
Implement keyboard functionality that moves the sprite using mouse or keyboard input using a separate script.
