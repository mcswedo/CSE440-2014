<h1>Hello World - Input & Movement, Textures & Assets</h1>

<p>
Create a new Unity Project named "Hello World" or something similar. Do not import any packages, and setup defaults for 
your chosen path - 2D or 3D.
</p>

<h2>
<b>For the 3D Path:</b>
</h2>

<p>
Create a scene with a directional colored light and a simple cube with a texture (either that you create yourself or you find online at a website such as <a href="www.lostandtaken.com">Lost and Taken</a>) that rotates along one or more axis using a script component written in C#. Experiment with multiple speeds of rotation.
</p>

<p>
Add mouse or keyboard functionality to change the axis of rotation during run-time (using the same script) and / or to move the cube in eight directions (using a separate script).
</p>

<h2>
<b>For the 2D Path:</b>
</h2>

<p>
Create a scene with a simple sprite with a texture that changes upon mouse click or button press using a script component written in C#.
</p>

<p>
Implement keyboard functionality that moves the sprite using mouse or keyboard input using a separate script.
</p>

<p>
If you have additional time, create a new Material named "Sprite-Diffuse" or something similar. In the Shader dropdown box in the Inspector, select "Sprites/Diffuse." Then, go to your Sprite in the Hierarchy and change its Material to this new Material you just created.
</p>

<p>
Doing this will allow you to use Unity's lighting system for 2D sprites! This might come in handy for certain elements of your game. Some things might be affected by lighting, others might not. You will now notice tha your sprite is very, very dark. Fix this by adding a Directional Light to the scene.
</p>

<p>
Experiment with using point lights and other lighting effects to illuminate your sprite.
