<h2>Adding Music and Sound Effects</h2>

<p>
Unity has built-in support for both 2D (sound that starts at the camera and is played at the same volume no matter where you are) and 3D audio sources. 3D sound effects utilize properties such as the doppler effect and change in volume / pitch based on the distance you are from the sound. 
</p>

<p>
For this lesson, because of the ease of use, we will be using <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">BFXR</a> to generate sound effects and <a href="http://abundant-music.com/">Abundant Music</a> to generate music. If you have sound effects or music you created that you would prefer to use, you are welcome to do so.

<h2>For the 3D Path:</h2>

<p>
Add both a music track (as a 2D sound) and a 3D Sound Effect to your project. So that you can be certain the 3D sound is playing properly, feel free to set it to Loop in the inspector.

Add a music track and a 2D sound effect to your project.

<h2>Adding a Graphical User Interface</h2>

<p>
Unity also has a built-in set of GUI tools, for text, images, and other bits of information. To be honest, the Unity GUI is not very good, and sometimes slows down the performance of your game, but it will more than suffice for our basic needs.
</p>

<h2>For Both Paths:</h2>

<p>
Create and implement a GUIText for a "scoring" system in your game, and modify the GUIText's value in code. This could mean you can pick up items that increase your score or a variety of other methods of doing it. If you would like, and perhaps have extra time, attach a sound effect to the act of gaining score.
