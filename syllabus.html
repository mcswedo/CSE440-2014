<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
The following four types of activities will occur in lecture periods.
</p>

<ul>
<li>I will present course topics.</li>
<li>I will give quizzes and a final exam to assess your learning on course topics.</li>
<li>You will present progress on research and game projects in your career portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The lab periods will be used for activities that strengthen your understanding of
the topics presented in lecture. 
</p>

<p>
All required work is detailed in the course schedule, published on the Web.  
I will announced in class, or by email, any changes to required work, points, 
deadlines and quiz dates.
</p>

<p>
You will maintain your work on assignments in a remote Git repository that I will set up for you.
Only you and I will have access to your repository.
I will evaluate your work by looking at your source code,
building it and testing it.
</p>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students will learn how to develop games for both desktop and mobile operating systems.</li>
  <li>Students will improve their programming abilities.</li>
  <li>Students will progess with one or more projects in their career portfolios.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Improve mastery of C++ and object-oriented design.</li>
  <li>Learn the Lua programming language.</li>
  <li>Learn how to embed Lua in C-based projects.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use SDL for cross-platform game development projects that
      target Android, iOS, OS X, Windows and Linux.</li>
  <li>Improve mastery of an integrated development environment (IDE).</li>
  <li>Improve mastery of the Git revision control system.</li>
  <li>Learn the theory and practice of steering behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Criteria for Source Code</h2>

<p>
Writing a program to produce required behavior is not good enough for a full score in this class;
you must also write code that is readable by humans.  Program readability is important because
realÂ­world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new
functionality.  Program readability will be evaluated according to the following set of criteria.
</p>

<table class="table">
  <caption>Readability Criteria for Source Code</caption>

      <td>Necessary comments</td>
      <td>Are comments included when needed?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unnecessary comments</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Nonredundant</td>
      <td>When 2 or more places inside a program need to perform the same activity,
          is that activity defined as a function and called as such from where it is needed?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spelling</td>
      <td>Are user-defined identifiers free of spelling errors?
          Are comments and other documentation free of spelling and grammatical errors?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="callout">
  Don't use tabs for indentation in your source code in this course.
  Tabs display differently in different viewing and editing tools.
  In general, tabs will degrade readability for some people who read your code,
  especially if you mix tabs with spaces.
  If you want full score on your assignments in this course, you should not use tabs.
  If you are in the habit of pressing tab in your editor
  and want to continue working this way,
  look for an option in your editor to replace tabs with spaces.
</p>
 
<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
The normal scale will be used to assign a letter grade.
</p>
