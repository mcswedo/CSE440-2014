<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>
The creation of video games has become an area of much focus. Games are being used as a platform for entertainment, education, training, and many other disciplines and recreational activities. This course will introduce topics in how an idea of a game is transformed into an actual game. The course describes how an understanding of core concepts in video games are put together, and will provide adequate information and training necessary to becoming a professional Game Designer. 
</p>

<p>
The general objective of the course is to introduce the different game programming concepts, tools, and methodologies to enable the students to develop and write a game design document and build a prototype of the proposed video game.
</p>

<p>
The specific objectives of the course are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
(a) To learn how to write game design documentation.
</li>
<li>
(b) To develop a prototype of the proposed video game.
</li>
<li>
(c) To specify game play and mechanics.
</li>
<li>
(d) To learn about game design principles.
</li>
<li>
(e) To learn the use of the Unity game development tool.
</li>
<li>  
(f) To introduce several video games under development.
</li>
<li>
(g) To understand the concept of computational thinking in game development.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Completion and submission of assigned lab exercises.
</li>

<li>
Completion and submission of game design document.
</li>

<li>
Presentation and demo of prototype of proposed video game.
</li>

<li>
Attendance.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The class will be a collaboration with ART 326 (Interactive Multimedia Design) where every 
Tue the ART students will join CSE 440 from 12 – 12:50 pm and every Thu, CSE students will join ART 326 from 12 – 12:50 pm. The goal is for CSE students to learn about interactive multimedia design in game development and the ART students to learn about game design principles. To prove that the collaboration works is by producing a game design document and a prototype of the proposed video game by a combined team of CSE and ART students and present them on finals day.
</p>

<p>
Plagiarism will not be tolerated and the grade for plagiarizing is zero.
</p>

<p>
Each class meeting will be divided down into two parts, a lecture period and a lab session. The lectures will consist of traditional lectures taken from textbooks and references. There could be some guest speaking sessions and demonstrations.
</p>

<p>
The lab sessions will be project oriented and will consist of a combination of experimenting with actual games, and group activities involving designing and proposing a game idea complete with design documentations. 
</p>

<p>
You are to form teams for all work assigned in the lab. Your overall grade for submitted work and presentations will be based on your team as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Periods of presentation will be conducted both at the middle of the course and at the very end as a final. These presentations will consist of your team discussing work completed in the lab in a professional manner, complete with powerpoint presentations and demos. Areas of grading for the presentation include quality, professionalism, and content.
</p>

<p>
Deadlines consist of completed lab work, required documentations, and prototype of proposed video game. As there are designated due dates, late work will incur a penalty of 10% per school day late.
</p>

<p>  
If you are in need of an accommodation for a disability in order to participate in this class, please contact Services to Students with Disabilities at UH-183, 909.537.5238.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
The following is the formula to be used in computing your final average in the course:
</p>

<p>
<em>FA = 0.30 Prototype  +  0.30 GameDesignDocument +  0.35 LabWork  +  0.05 Attendance</em>
</p>

<p>
where  FA = final average.
