<h1>Introductions to GitHub and Unity</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>A quiz on this material can be found on <a href="L1Quiz.html">this page</a>.</h3>

<p>
The Git version control system was originally developed to manage the source code for the Linux kernel. 
Since then, it has become widely used for many projects, both open and closed source, on all platforms. 
In this course, you will submit your work on assignments by committing them 
into a remote GitHub repository that you set up for yourself.
</p>

<p>
Along with setting up and learning GitHub,
you will also practice setting up a Unity project. 
GitHub and the Unity platform form the development environment
for this course, and are required for every student. Unity is installed on each
JB360 Lab computer, but GitHub is not. I strongly recommend saving your Unity work on an
external drive (as project files can get very large very quickly) and working from a home
computer to submit your work to GitHub.
</p>

<h2>GitHub Setup</h2>

<p>
Visit <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and create a free account, if you do not already have one. 
Next, download the Github client for your respective platform 
- <a href="https://windows.github.com/">Windows</a> or <a href="https://mac.github.com/">Mac OSX</a> -
and sign in with your account on the client. 
</p>

<p>
Click the + sign in the top left corner, and create a new repository with a name related to the course.
It will ask you for a Local Path (default is fine) and a Git ignore - please select the "Unity" Git ignore.
The Git ignore file is a hidden file that tracks what kind of files should never be uploaded to GitHub,
files like preferences and solutions and other temporary files will be automatically excluded if you select
the proper Git ignore file. Click Publish Repository in the top right corner to publish your repository online.
</p>

<p>
Next, navigate to the folder that has been created - if you used the default path, 
this will be Users/YOURNAME/My Documents/GitHub on Windows and in your root Users folder on Mac. 
Open up your folder and create a new text file named "README.md". Type something in this file and save it.
The contents do not matter - this document will control what is shown underneath your repository online
as a description.
</p>

<p>
The file's extension <em>.md</em> stands for <em>markdown</em>,
which is a markup language that is designed to be readable in both raw and interpreted forms.
You can think of it as a lightweight substitute for HTML that many programmers use.
You can read about 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">the Markdown syntax here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Return to the GitHub client. Near the top left, you should now see a bar that says "Uncommitted Changes."
Click the "Show" button next to this text, and type a brief message in the summary stating
what the changes you made to the repository were. Next, click "Commit to master," and then "Sync" 
in the top right corner. <b>These are the steps - Review changes, Commit, Sync - to commit any new content to your repository.</b>
</p>

<h2>Unity</h2>

<p>
This course will cover the Unity development environment, and requires
each student to have access to the development tools, either in the labs or on a home computer.
The Unity tool can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/unity/download">the Unity3D website</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unity is a powerful, free-to-use development environment for game creation that allows developers to create games
using its editor and program them using either a proprietary UnityScript (JavaScript-like) language,
or the language C#. This course will focus on programming in C# primarily for the reason that it is
a more wide-spread, useful language in future work.
</p>

<p>
Unity also has an Asset Store, from which users can download or purchase assets, including models, terrain,
scripts, and all sorts of other features. <b>However, I discourage members of this class to use 
the asset store if it can be avoided.</b> I strongly encourage members of this course to work on 
fleshing out systems and concepts of their game, and not stress over asset creation. Several students of
the art department will be here to assist in concept art and potentially in-game asset creation, but
it is much better to have well-thought-out and developed game systems so that you can show the instructors
and your fellow students how your game is played and why it is an enjoyable concept to further pursue developing.
</p>

<p>
Unity tutorials and development will commence in the next lesson. To end, please send an email to
Michael Swedo at mcswedo@gmail.com with your name and which set of lessons (a choice between 2D and 3D)
you wish to be a part of. <b><a href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/editor">
Please begin familiarizing yourself with the interface</a> (as it is
very complex for a beginner) before the next lesson.</b> I will assume that, come next Tuesday, each student
will have watched and understood Beginner videos 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 - a total time investment of approximately 24 minutes.

<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP - Image creation / editing software</a>. As substitute for this, if you own Photoshop, it works better. GIMP is merely free for those who do not. <br>

<a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a> <br>
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender - 3D Model creation / editing software</a>. I do not expect anyone in this class to create 3D models, but if you are interested in learning how to do that, I suggest you become accustomed to Blender. <br>
