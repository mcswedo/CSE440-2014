<h1>Tutorials In Unity</h1>

<h2>Tutorial Project</h2>

<p>
Following are links to several tutorials spanning several genres of video games, all of which teach both basics of Unity development and also get into more advanced topics. Please choose the tutorial that is most similar to the game project you wish to work on, as it will teach you some required tools, techniques, and programming skills applicable to your project.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/stealth">Stealth - a 3D isometric, third-person stealth action game</a></b>
</p>

<p>
Stealth is one of two tutorial projects created and maintained by the Unity developers themselves, and demonstrates how an isometric game functions. Properties of this game can be applied to both third- and first-person 3D games as well, and the logic demonstrated is incredibly useful for 3D development.

<p>
<b><a href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter">Space Shooter - an orthographic, arcade-like space shooter using 3D assets</a></b>
</p>

<p>
Space Shooter is the other tutorial project currently available from the Unity developers, and it details how an orthographic (zero perspective), top-down space shooter can be easily created in the Unity engine. Fundamentals taught in this tutorial can be used in both 3D and 2D development of side-scrollers, platformers, and obviously arcade-style shooters.

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/61532/unity-2d-tutorial-getting-started">Zombie Conga - a 2D, top-down, mouse (or touch) input based tutorial on Unity's 2D toolkit</a></b>
</p>

<p>
Zombie Conga's tutorial is a very detailed look into Unity's 2D functionality, and explains many things about how Sprites are handled, how to use 2D objects in Unity's environment, and its lessons can also be applied to mobile game development. It is an incredibly powerful tutorial for 2D development, and can be applied to side scrollers, platformers, and any and all 2D, sprite-based game concepts.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/runner/">Runner - a 2.5D 'infinite' platformer</a></b>
</p>

<p>
Runner covers such concepts as procedural generation and platformer movement controls, and can be likened to games such as Canabalt or Robot Unicorn Attack - an "infinite runner" game. It is a simple yet powerful tutorial that explains primarily 2.5D platformer development (IE, flat-plane movement with perspective) and can be applied to mobile-based games as well.
