<h1>Developing Games in Unity, Part 1</h1>

<h2>A "Hello World" Equivalent</h2>

<p>
Create a new Unity Project named "Hello World" or something similar. Do not import any packages, and setup defaults for 
your chosen path - 2D or 3D.
</p>

<p>
<b>For the 3D Path:</b>
</p>

<p>
Create a scene with a directional colored light and a simple cube with a texture that rotates along one or more axis using a script component written in C#. Experiment with multiple speeds of rotation.
</p>

<p>
If you have additional time, add mouse or keyboard functionality to change the axis of rotation during run-time (using the same script) or to move the cube in eight directions (using a separate script).
</p>

<p>
<b>For the 2D Path:</b>
</p>

<p>
Create a scene with a simple sprite with a texture that changes upon mouse click or button press using a script component written in C#.
</p>

<p>
If you have additional time, implement keyboard functionality that moves the sprite using mouse or keyboard input using a separate script.
